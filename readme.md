# aDDapt.js

## About

This project exists to try to fill the gap for a stylable select box that works well across all browsers.

It requires jQuery to function, i don't know the minimum version I have been using 1.8.1 but it may work well with older versions.

P.S DD means drop down. There is a point to the name :P

## How to
$(selectbox).addapt();

This mostly uses values from the stylesheet, make sure you include that. It isn't amazingly configurable at the minute without editing the script, but hopefully it should be soon.
